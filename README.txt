                                 BrokePad
            An unconventional Notepad replacement for Windows

Modern text editors are cool and all, but have you ever stopped to think
about the step back that they've been from the traditional typewriter?
More specifically, modern editors have lost many key features that gave
typewriters such a likeable typing experience:

 - The satisfying mechanical sounds produced as the type bars strike the
   page and return to the home position, as well as the carriage return.
 - The consistent typography and styling across all documents-no wasted
   time changing fonts, sizes, and colors.

If so, BrokePad is the editor you've been looking for! It offers all the
innovative features of the typewriter described above at the convenience
of your computer, as well as all the inherent quirks of the original
device that that modern text editors tried to "fix" over the years:

 - The page physically moves while typing; the cursor remains in place
 - The constant lightening of the font color as the typewriter's ink
   starts to deplete (which you've probably already noticed by now)

Enjoy!
